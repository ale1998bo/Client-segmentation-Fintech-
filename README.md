# Client-segmentation-Fintech

Hello World! :wave:

This is the README of the final project of the Fintech Course (Academic Year 2021/2022).

## HOW TO NAVIGATE THIS SEA OF DOCUMENTS  :ocean:

  The project was carried out using two programming languages: R and Matlab. This is the content of the documents we have attached:

  1) **FINAL_PROJECT_FINTECH.zip** : 
                Here you can find an .html output file that combines the two codes. 
                In this code we decided to embed one of the possible methods to execute the selected task: Business Case 2.        
		    _PS: To view the plots, you must open the .html file in the same directory where the images folder is located._

  2) **FINAL_PROJECT.pdf**  :
		    In this pdf ther are the slides describing our project. 
                We, however, recommend viewing the presentation from the following [link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-9eVAz0XmIaeX8f4P4Her8THsvThPwtf/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108681062918193188397&rtpof=true&sd=true).
		    This will allow you, to view the animations, through the slideshow. 

  3) **FINAL_PROJECT.Rmd**  :
		    This is the R code of 1 (FINAL_PROJECT_All.html).
		    This is an executable notebook.
		    
  4) **FINAL_PROJECT.mlx**  :
		    This is the Matlab code of 1 (FINAL_PROJECT_All.html). 
		    This is an executable notebook.


  We have however, tried multiple methodologies and techniques, 
  which are written in the following codes: 

  5) **FINAL_PROJECT_All.Rmd**  			

  6) **FINAL_PROJECT_All.mlx**

  
  Also, last but not least, the datasets to run the codes, placed in this folder: 

  7) **DATASETS.zip**
